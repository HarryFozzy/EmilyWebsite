        <h1>Welcome to Emily Parker Photograhy</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Emily and I am a photographer based in Branton, Doncaster. I mainly focus on newborn and family photography, however I love getting involved in other areas too! I have a studio at my home but I also do photoshoots at other locations, you’ll often find me in fields or woods trying to capture those gorgeous candid shots.
<br>
          I have always loved photography, but it has only really been something I have wanted to pursue as a business since becoming a mother. I found myself reaching for my camera at every given opportunity to try and hold on to each and every memory whilst my daughter is little. I’ve realised how quickly they grow up and how precious creating those memories in time are and that I want to do the same for others. 
          <br>
          I am very passionate about providing a good service and quality images for my clients. I would love for you to check out my gallery to see my photography journey.
